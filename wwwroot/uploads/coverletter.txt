I have more than 10 years experience in developing C#.NET and ASP.NET applications. And I really love developing .NET applications. I've graduated as a geological engineering.

My attention to learning and searching new development technologies and good communication abilities have allowed me to achieve and exist in this field.

I have worked as a front-end and back-end developer. Now I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer and responsible for leading my colleagues and alignment of the technical direction. You can find detailed information on my resume but I want to say that I have an expertise in C#, .NET CORE, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, CQRS Pattern with MediatR, Javascript, jQuery, Typescript, AJAX, SignalR, NodeJS, Angular, CSS, HTML5, Docker, RabbitMQ, Firebase, PostgreSQL, MSSQL.
